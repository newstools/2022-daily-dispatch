The Department of Basic Education should publish the matric results on media platforms, the Gauteng High Court in Pretoria ruled on Tuesday. The department had earlier this month announced that media outlets would no longer be allowed to publish matric results, citing concerns over the Protection of Personal Information (POPI) Act. The decision was roundly condemned by media houses, with the SA National Editors’ Forum slamming the lack of consultation by the department and pointing out the negative financial implications for media companies. Eastern Cape education unions, on the other hand, welcomed the department's call to end the tradition with National Professional Teachers’ Organisation of SA  Eastern Cape CEO Loyiso Mbinda saying: “The publication of learner results has in the past caused emotional harm.” The National Senior Certificate results will be released on January 21.
