Police minister Bheki Cele has threatened to take legal action after a social media user claimed he and his “daughter” were  at a Cape Town nightclub for her birthday. The user posted videos on Twitter claiming Cele was at Coco nightclub with his “daughter” Khumbuza Cele. Cele was criticised on Twitter after the videos were posted, with some saying he was a hypocrite because  he often calls for stricter restrictions on alcohol sales and nightclubs. Speaking on eNCA, Cele denied  the woman in the videos was his daughter and said they simply share the same name. Cele said he wanted the claims to be retracted or he would  take legal action. “There are two Khumbuza Celes but that’s not my daughter. My daughter is at home in Durban,” said Cele. His spokesperson Lirandzu Themba  confirmed that the person in  the Twitter videos was not the police minister’s daughter. In the same interview, Cele said he had nothing against liquor and partying, as long as it was done responsibly. Cele said the past festive season was safer, with fewer crime incidents reported and the  police recording many successes.
