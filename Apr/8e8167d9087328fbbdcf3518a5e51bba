The lawyer representing four of the five men accused of murdering Bafana Bafana player Senzo Meyiwa was served with a warrant for his arrest in court on Thursday. Advocate Maselela Teffo had earlier been cross-examining Sgt Thabo Mosia, who had collected evidence at the Vosloorus home where Meyiwa was killed in October 2014. But in a surprise turn of events after the lunch adjournment he was served with an arrest warrant and led down to the holding cells. The arrest appeared to be related to a failure to appear in court. The arrest was performed in full view off the accused and the court gallery. The five accused are Muzikawukhulelwa Sibiya, Bongani Sandiso Ntanzi, Mthobisi Prince Mncube, Mthokoziseni Maphisa and Sifisokuhle Nkani Ntuli. They have all pleaded not guilty to premeditated murder, attempted murder, robbery with aggravating circumstances, possession of firearms without a licence and possession of ammunition. This is a developing story. TimesLIVE
