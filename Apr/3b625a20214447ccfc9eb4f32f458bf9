Adze, a four-year-old Belgian Shepherd police patrol dog, sniffed out equipment believed to belong to abalone poachers from the bushes near the Fish River near Port Alfred. The equipment, with an estimated value of more than R50,000, was found on Wednesday at about 6am. Police spokesperson Warrant Officer Majola Nkohli said the energetic Adze, and his handler, Warrant Officer Tertius Neethling, were following up on leads about suspected abalone poachers, who were believed to have been operating near the Fish River and the area covering the nearby nature reserve. Four-legged K9 officer, Adze, was taken out of the vehicle to join the search and focused in the area with dense shrubs where he quickly located the haul. The seized equipment included wetsuits, diving fins, diving booties, diving gloves and shucking tools. DispatchLIVE
