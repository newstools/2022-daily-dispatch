After  spectacularly failing to launch the T20 Global League (T20GL) in 2017, Cricket  SA (CSA)  is giving it another go with the launch of another competition next year. CSA announced on Friday morning that  an agreement with SuperSport had been signed to form a new company that  would manage the  new T20 competition. According to CSA, plans for the competition are well under way and the first ball is expected to be bowled in January 2023. January will become the window for the league that will comprise of six privately owned franchises playing each other in a double round before the top three sides move to the play-off stages. “We are excited by the formation of something this fresh and invigorating which also offers the opportunity for private investment in the franchises,” said CSA CEO Pholetsi Moseki. “CSA has already received interest from a number of potential local and international investors.” Moseki  said this  was an entirely new event, adding that SA has a rich crop of talent who would benefit from exposure through a franchise league. A sustainable business model had been created for  the league and the teams, with a healthy salary bill to attract the  best local and international players. “The league also represents a fresh injection of funds into the sport in SA which will help grow the game. Modelled along the lines of T20 events worldwide, the focus will be on all-action cricket sportainment." “We are delighted to invest in a product that will change the face of  SA cricket,” said SuperSport CEO Marc Jury. “There is an early-year gap in the calendar, so the timing is ideal.” TimesLIVE
