A 46-year-old murder suspect is alleged to have jumped to his death after attacking an arresting police officer in an  Amanzimtoti flat, south of Durban, on Saturday night. KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson Constable Thenjiswa Ngcobo said Amanzimtoti police were called to Beach Road where they were shown the body of a man who had plunged to his death  off a building. “It is alleged  Brighton Beach police officers were tracing a wanted murder suspect. He was traced to a flat in Amanzimtoti. When the officers were effecting an arrest, the suspect resisted and  stabbed the arresting officer on both hands. “The suspect then tried to escape through a window and succumbed to his injuries. An  inquest docket was opened at the Amanzimtoti police station,” said Ngcobo. It is understood the arresting officer was not critically injured. TimesLIVE
