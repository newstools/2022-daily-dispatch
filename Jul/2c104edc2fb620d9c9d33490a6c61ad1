Eskom's chief nuclear officer, Riedewaan  Bakardien, has resigned to join a Canadian nuclear entity in an executive position. He will depart on July 31 after 27 years at Eskom. “As the only nuclear power station in Africa, we have all played a role in keeping the plant safe, and the best place to work. The decision to resign was by no means an easy decision,” said Bakardien. Keith Featherstone, an experienced executive with more than 30 years of nuclear experience and a previous Koeberg power station manager, will act in the position while the recruitment process is under way, said Eskom. The current acting Koeberg power station general manager, Nomawethu  Mtwebana, is also heading for North America. She has been selected by the World Association of Nuclear Operators (Wano) in Atlanta, US, to join as a “reverse loanee” for the next year. “She will be a peer reviewer, reviewing performance at various plants in the US during her time at Wano. Ms Mtwebana will then bring this learning experience back to Koeberg,” said Eskom. Mahesh  Valaitham, a manager with 27 years'  nuclear power plant experience, will be filling in for her in an acting capacity. “We wish to assure the people of South Africa and fellow guardians at Eskom that the organisation has access to a sufficiently experienced and competent executive team to continue ensuring a safe and smooth operation at Africa's only nuclear power station,” said Jan Oberholzer, Eskom's COO.
