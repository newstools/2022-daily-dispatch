The Hawks have seized counterfeit Ford and Volkswagen vehicle parts worth R150,000 in Gauteng. Lt-Col Philani Nkwalase, spokesperson for the directorate, said the Hawks’ intellectual property rights and tactical operations management sections, with brand protector experts from Spoor & Fisher Attorneys, raided two businesses in Kempton Park and Midrand on Wednesday and Friday. “These two operations were preceded by a meticulous investigation into the allegations of dealing in counterfeit vehicle parts and accessories sold under the guise of genuine Ford and Volkswagen branded products,” said Nkwalase. “A test purchase of products to secure successful search warrants, which were obtained for each of the business premises, was executed.” Nkwalase said two suspects aged 33 and 40 will be summoned to appear in court for contravention of the Counterfeit Goods Act. “The goods ... were seized and transported to the designated counterfeit goods depot pending the finalisation of the criminal and civil cases against the suspects.” TimesLIVE
