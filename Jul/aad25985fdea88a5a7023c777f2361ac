The body of seven-year-old Khayalethu Magadla, who fell into a manhole while playing with friends in Soweto in June, was found on Saturday afternoon at the Eldorado Park Cemetery wastewater plant. Johannesburg EMS spokesperson Nana Radebe-Kgiba said Magadla was found in the splitter chamber on the first manhole towards the sump situated near the cemetery. “Today at about 12:23 Khayalethu Magadla was recovered by a rescue and recovery team comprising of 35 EMS, hazmat and urban search and technicians, water unit, K-9 unit and air wing, Delta Scan, ambulances from Gauteng province and 60 members of Joburg Water.” She added that the EMS specialised team searched through the challenging pipeline system. “The urban search and rescue teams have covered at least 20km from Dlamini to Eldorado Park.” Radebe-Kgiba said the city was committed to assisting the family after the tragic event. “Joburg Water has assisted immensely with drainage of water from different sewer systems. We send our deepest condolences to the family in this time of difficulty and hope they find closure now that Khayalethu is found,” she said. TimesLIVE
