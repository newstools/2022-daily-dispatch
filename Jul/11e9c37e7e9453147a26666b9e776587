Popular Umhlobo Wenene FM’s presenter Rev Mzukisi Faleni has been fired. This after Faleni was suspended by the station on allegations of conflict of interest following his inclusion “as a contributor” to a programme at Zibonele FM, a community radio station in the Western Cape. Faleni, who hosted the programme the Sunday programmes Imvuselelo and Isandulela Senkonzo, was fired on Friday. SABC head of communications and stakeholder relations, Ndileka Cola, confirmed Faleni has been fired. “Umhlobo Wenene Management can confirm that the independent contractor agreement with Rev. Mzukisi Faleni has been terminated. Rev Faleni hosted the programme Imvuselelo on Umhlobo Wenene FM on Sundays. “This is due to a material breach of his freelance contract. “To ensure Imvuselelo's continuity, Nomonde Vakalisa will step in as presenter until the programme's new structure is finalised,” said Cola. Faleni confirmed he has received a letter terminating his contract with Umhlobo Wenene. He said he was seeking a legal opinion over the matter. He had denied the conflict of interest and said he was a freelancer at Umhlobo Wenene FM. He said he believed Zibonele FM was not Umhlobo Wenene’s competitor. DispatchLIVE
