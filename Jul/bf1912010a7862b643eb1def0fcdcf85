The start of the  ANC Youth League secretary-general Sindiso Magaqa  murder trial in the Pietermaritzburg  high court was again delayed on Tuesday. At issue is the ballistic report which defense council Shane Matthews said he was yet to receive from the state. Matthews told the court  an AK47 implicating accused number four has also yet to be assessed by an expert who is abroad. Judge Kate Pillay expressed  her concern over the logistical difficulties hampering the start of the trial. On Monday, the case  was postponed after  Matthews filed an application for his client, Mlungisi Ncalane, 33, to undergo psychiatric evaluation. Pillay said her availability was limited to this session which  started on Monday as she had other commitments  in a tribunal not linked to this matter. The trial has been set down for three weeks. The politician was killed in a hail of bullets in 2017. The matter has been adjourned to next Wednesday to allow the state to submit a ballistics report and further particulars. Sbonelo Myeza, 39, Mbulelo Mpofana, 34, Ncalane,  33, and Sibusiso Ncengwa, 30, stood on the dock in the packed courtroom. Ncengwa's  lawyer  told the court  he was being denied food at  the correctional facility. This was  denied by a prison official  present in court. Matthews said Ncalane's  mental health  problems  were caused by  alcohol and marijuana abuse. Outside the court, ANC supporters  in  party regalia continued to chant and sing. TimesLIVE
