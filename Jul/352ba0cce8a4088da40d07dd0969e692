Five people have been arrested after security guards  on duty at Middelburg Provincial Hospital were allegedly shot at by guards from another company on Thursday. Police spokesperson Brig Selvy Mohlala said no-one was hospitalised, but  one guard was treated for injuries and discharged. “It is further alleged that rubber bullets were used.” Mohlala said the matter was reported to the police in Middelburg and  five suspects aged between 26 and 40  were arrested. The charges include discharging a firearm in a public space and assault with intent to  do grievous bodily harm. “Police are also looking at probing the allegations that a live round was fired during the incident.” The motive is yet to be established and the  suspects are expected to appear  in the Middelburg magistrate's court soon. Mpumalanga police commissioner  Lt-Gen Semakaleng Daphney Manamela  condemned  the incident, adding the duty of members of the security cluster  is to maintain peace. “The behaviour displayed at the hospital can never be tolerated or accepted, especially coming from  security officers or any officer of the law. Instead, members of the security cluster should be exemplary in [their] conduct. We hope that the law will take its course.” TimesLIVE Support independent journalism by subscribing to the Sunday Times. Just R20 for the first month.
