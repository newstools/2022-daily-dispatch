Major League DJz are  on their way to achieving their mission to take amapiano  to the world. DJz were beaming with pride when announcing  they had sold out a show at Parallel nightclub in Amsterdam on Friday. Speaking exclusively to BBC Radio 1Xtra’s Jeremiah Asiamah, Major League DJz reveal the star-studded feature list for their next album, which includes Jorja Smith, Tinie Tempah, Ty Dolla $ign, Mahalia and Stefflon Don. They also hinted at a possible Drake collaboration. Major League DJz discussed what fans  could expect from their next album. “We’re going international vibes. We’re trying to make it African melodies, but English vocals”. Asked by Asiamah whether they  could confirm  names on the album, the  SA twin brothers  said: “OK, OK, Jorja Smith, Mahalia, Ty Dolla Sign and ... Tinie Tempah.” They also hinted that they  were waiting on a potential collaboration with hip-hop superstar Drake: “But we need the big OVO [Drake] to confirm, that’s what we need. “So let’s get this right, we’re expecting a Major League DJz project featuring Tinie Tempah, Mahalia, Jorja Smith, Stefflon Don ... and maybe even a Drake?” asked the host, to which the brothers confirm: “Yeah, and Ty [Dolla Sign].” Major League DJz are the  SA DJ duo  of Bandile Mbere and Banele Mbere. Over the past  few years they have taken the world by storm, most recently performing at the iconic music festival, Coachella, bringing the sounds of amapiano to the global stage.
