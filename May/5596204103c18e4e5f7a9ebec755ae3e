A further 56 cases his unit was involved in  were being heard  in the high court. “The rand value of the contracts to be set aside there is R62.3bn. Combined, we've got matters in the high court and in the Special Tribunal for processing and adjudication and recovery to the contract value of R75.1bn. “We need to ensure that we gear up, we capacitate our civil litigation department, ensure that we process these matters as speedily as possible. “We will develop a corruption risk management framework which we will pilot in some areas.” His presentation showed  that the number of proclamations signed for his unit to  investigate  increased by 122% between 2016 and 2022. “We've got about 58 proclamations that we expect in this year.
