A field ranger at Kruger National Park (KNP) was shot dead on Wednesday afternoon. South African National Parks spokesperson Isaac Phaahla confirmed that a field ranger succumbed to his injuries after being shot  while on duty with his colleagues in the Shangoni section of reserve. “Details are still sketchy at this stage but we will get a clearer picture tomorrow (Thursday) after the traumatised colleagues have deposed their statements. The name  of the victim is being withheld until next of kin have  been notified,” said Phaahla. The incident follows the arrest of two field rangers  on charges related to fraud, money laundering and corruption in April. TimesLIVE
