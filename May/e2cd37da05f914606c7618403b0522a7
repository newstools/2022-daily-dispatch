South Africa has been left in stitches after a video of woman seen making away with a cow’s head went viral. The unidentified woman,  dubbed “the looter of the year”, was caught on video helping herself to a  cow’s head that  fell off a truck  transporting  meat on the N4. According to 702, a truck transporting cow heads was travelling on the N4 when it was involved in an accident. People driving by took advantage of the situation and started looting the truck. No-one involved in the accident was hurt. In the video, a traffic officer can be seen running beside the woman and recording the incident on her phone instead of stopping her. People can also be heard laughing in the background. Watch the video: On social media, many reacted with laughter, with some praising her strength. Others criticised the traffic  officer for recording the incident  instead of arresting the woman. Here is a snapshot of some reactions: “I don’t find it funny. This is encouraging more looting. This metro police officer should be reprimanded for her actions,” wrote Barend Van Heerden. “Disgraceful and sad. Lawlessness and stealing is a new norm in SA because  law enforcement officers look as if this is fine to do,” wrote Dixon Pillay. “You see a thief, I see a victim of this system that has rendered finishing school useless. Under normal circumstances, that lady wouldn’t  touch that bloody cow head, but poverty has activated a sense of desperation deep within her soul,” wrote Bukhosi Bemvelo.
