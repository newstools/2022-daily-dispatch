The Gauteng education department on Thursday said three school pupils who are siblings  died in Ratanda, Heidelberg,  after allegedly consuming  energy drinks they had been given by their father. Two of the siblings died at school while the third died on  the way to hospital. A  fourth is in a critical condition while a fifth sibling had not consumed the drink. The  department  said  the cause of  death was not confirmed, but MEC Panyaza Lesufi took to his Twitter account to say  the father may have been behind the deaths. Lesufi  expressed sorrow at the news. “First, I wish to convey my sincerest condolences to the family, particularly the mother, of the deceased learners. I further extend my condolences to friends, fellow learners and teachers of the learners, especially those who had witnessed these tragic incidents,” Lesufi said. The boys, aged six, 13 and 16, were  pupils at Ratanda Primary and Khanya Lesedi Secondary schools  in Ratanda. The department's spokesperson Steve Mabona said preliminary reports allege  the father  gave  his five children “energy drinks” in the morning while they were preparing for school. “Four of the  learners consumed the energy drink after arriving at school on Thursday. Sadly, two of the  learners died shortly [afterwards] at the school after complaining of stomach pains, while one was rushed to the nearest hospital but died on the way. The fourth sibling is in a critical condition at the hospital, while the fifth, fortunately, did not consume the energy drink.” Mabona said the department has dispatched its psychosocial support unit to the affected schools to offer counselling to the school community. The services have also been offered to the bereaved family. Lesufi is expected to visit  the schools and the family  on Friday. TimesLIVE
