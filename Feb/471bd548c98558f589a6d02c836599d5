On Tuesday the Passenger Rail Agency of SA (Prasa) told the media  about Operation Ziveze, which means “show yourself” in Nguni. The operation,  which aims to eradicate  corruption and “clean up” Prasa,  has led to the  discovery of 3,000 alleged ghost employees. Prasa  cannot determine how long these people have been in the system, but  billions  could potentially have been lost. According to Prasa’s records,  it had 17,000 employees. “We said for you to be paid, you must come forward for us to verify you,” said Prasa human capital and remuneration chair Smanga Sethene. “Bring your  qualifications and identity  document and your supervisor should be present during the process of verification,” Sethene said. Prasa confirmed that  of  17,000 employees recorded on its system, only 14,000 came forward. Prasa board of control chair Leonard Ramatlakane said: “We will find  which of the 14,000  have been receiving in  lieu of the 3,000  who have not arrived.”
