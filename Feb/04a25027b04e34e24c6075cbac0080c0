Six armed and masked men stormed an Eastern Cape game lodge on Saturday night and  held a family and guests at gunpoint while robbing them of cash and firearms. Police spokesperson Sergeant Majola Nkohli said the incident had taken place close to the N2 outside Committees Drift, about 30km from Makhanda, at 8.55pm. “The victim was ushered into his bedroom, where the suspects stole an undisclosed amount of cash and his firearm with ammunition. “During the incident, a guest’s firearm was also stolen,” Nkohli said. The men also took all the cellphones belonging to the owner and guests, so that it took longer for them to contact the police. Nkohli said cash and other valuables had also been stolen before the suspects fled. There were no injuries. The six masked suspects are still at large. A neighbouring farmer said: “Obviously you are psychologically scarred when something like this happens, but it’s a wake-up call for all of us to tighten up our community security backup and communication systems.” “We are all just very relieved that no-one was hurt.” Police have urged anyone with information that could lead to the arrest of the suspects to contact the investigating officer, Detective Warrant Officer George Cook, on 084-648-1749.
