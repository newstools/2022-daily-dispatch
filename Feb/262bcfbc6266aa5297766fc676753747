Sibongile Mani, who splurged nearly a million of NSFAS funds erroneously paid into her account has been convicted of theft. More than R14m was erroneously deposited in Mani, an Walter Sisulu University student's account in 2017. Within two hours on June 1 when the money was deposited to her, she spent more than R20, 0000. Her account was eventually blocked in August 14 by Intellimali. East London regional court magistrate Twanet Olivier on Monday , before handing the judgement said Mani's actions did not speak of a person who lacked knowledge. She was an accounting student, a student leader and an activist at the University. “The accused is described as a student activist in her own right, was in a leadership position at the university in 2017 and also the secretary of a student organisation. Based on the above alone, can it be said that the accused did not know the loan amount of the agreement she entered into in her second year of studies? “The court is satisfied that the version of the state is reliable,” Olivier said. Mani will be back in the dock on March 8 for pre-sentencing reports. DispatchLIVE
