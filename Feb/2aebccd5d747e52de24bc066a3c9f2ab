Four lions rescued from a French circus will be housed at a reserve in the Eastern Cape. According to the Born Free Foundation, the animals were born in  captivity and  sold as cubs to circuses in France, where they were made to perform tricks in front of crowds. They were rescued after the foundation solicited the support of the public to rally behind its “Goodbye to the Circus” appeal. “The generosity of our supporters in 2020 meant we successfully raised funds to move the four lions — rescued from appalling conditions in a circus — from their temporary home in France. “But then Covid-19 hit and, like many of us, they’ve been  waiting since then for their real lives to begin at our sanctuary in SA,” the organisation said. “A gift to our 'Lions of Lockdown' appeal  will help give Angela, Bellone, Saïda and Louga the enriched, loving care for the life they deserve.” The lions will be placed at Shamwari game reserve in the Eastern Cape where they can explore a spacious three-acre bush enclosure. “We are making our final preparations for the lions’  move. How I long to go with them to SA ... Thank you for helping us transform their lives,” said Born Free foundation’s Virginia McKenna. “Our sanctuary at Shamwari will be 25 years old on  March 29, having  opened in 1997. Poignantly, that is the same date that my husband Bill died, back in 1994. In his memory, this year we celebrate Born Free’s Year of the Lion, the year he would have turned 100 if he had lived.” TimesLIVE
