Head of policy at AfriForum Ernst Roets says he is  satisfied with day seven of court proceedings between the lobby group and the EFF, but some on social media don't agree. EFF leader Julius Malema was on Wednesday cross-examined by AfriForum's counsel, advocate Mark Oppenheimer, in connection with the  “Kill the Boer, kill the farmer” chant often  heard at EFF events and during a court case in Senekal in the Free State two years ago. Roets said Oppenheimer did a good  job “exposing” Malema's bias. While some agreed with Roets' analysis of proceedings, many said  it was Malema who  should be celebrating. Malema was quizzed about the chant and whether he agrees that it incites farm killings. He said he did not agree. He defended the EFF leadership, saying the lyrics they chanted were “Kiss the Boer”, which was meant to agitate and offend “racist white people who were opposed to blacks kissing whites”. He was  asked about the sound made in the  chant that resembles a gunshot.  Malema said it should not be interpreted in the literal sense. It was not the same as shooting a real gun in the air. Oppenheimer asked if Malema would fire a gun, but he did not respond. He was also asked about farm murders. He said all South Africans, regardless of race and land ownership, were victims of crime. Labelling farm murders as such, elevated white people over blacks, who were also victims. TimesLIVE
