The planned taxi industry strike and total shutdown, which was to commence on Monday, has been called off. The strike, which was announced on Thursday, was called off on Sunday afternoon following an urgent intervention by Eastern Cape premier Oscar Mabuyane after the provincial transport department had come up with some of the R73m it has owed to scholar transports service providers since November. The decision to call off the strike and planned total shutdown came up after Mabuyane had spent long hours in behind closed doors meeting with Santaco leaders, various taxi and bus associations and scholar transport operators in Mthatha. During the meeting, the premier assured industry players that all outstanding invoices would be paid in the next seven days. DispatchLIVE
