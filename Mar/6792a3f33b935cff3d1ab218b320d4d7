The R350 social relief of distress (SRD) grant pilot project has been extended to include Shoprite, Checkers, Usave and OK Foods. On Thursday the Shoprite Group announced  beneficiaries can  collect their payments at its 1,286 supermarkets across SA. “Following the extension of the grant for another 12 months, customers can  access it at the till point in any Shoprite, Checkers, Usave and selected OK Foods supermarket nationally. “This enables customers to receive their grant, buy essential groceries and pay their bills at a single location,” said the group. The latest collection points are among several introduced by the SA Social Security Agency (Sassa) to make grant collection easy for beneficiaries. Among other collection points, beneficiaries can also collect their payments from Pick n Pay and Boxer stores. Last year, the SA Post Office (Sapo) said it was hoping to get other supermarkets, including Spar, on board to enable people from small towns to collect their payments at  its store collection points. “Spar is well represented in smaller towns so we hope to get them on board as soon as possible,” said Sapo. Recipients can collect their payments at post offices by using the ID number system which determines payment dates according to the last three digits of beneficiaries’ identity numbers.
