Fans have flooded social media in shock at claims that businessman Siviwe “Chippa” Mpengesi could challenge Danny Jordaan for the position of SA Football Association (Safa) president. Mpengesi is owner of Chippa United and  known for his trigger-happy approach of firing coaches when results don't go his team's way. According to City Press, Mpengesi has been approached by some in the Eastern Cape and Western Cape and encouraged to contest the Safa presidential elections. Mpengesi told the paper he had been approached, but said he had not yet made a decision. He  would hand the  reins over at Chippa United if he decided to throw his hat in the ring and won the election. Mpengesi   called for young blood at the head of SA football. The news was shared by popular sports broadcaster Robert Marawa and sparked a big  debate on social media. Marawa partnered with Arena Holdings late last year to broadcast his award-winning sports show live on its platforms, including SowetanLIVE, Vuma FM in KwaZulu-Natal and Rise FM in Mpumalanga. TimesLIVE is part of the Arena Holdings group, along with SowetanLIVE, Rise FM and Vuma FM. The weekly 90-minute show can be streamed between 5.30pm and 7pm. While many shared their surprise at Mpengesi possibly running for the position, others joked  it would throw SA football into disarray and “bankrupt” the organisation. Former Bafana Bafana star Mark Fish gave the idea the thumbs down,  exclaiming: “oh no”.
