While SA’s most loved, and hated, puppet Chester Missing prepares for his upcoming show at the Johannesburg International Comedy Festival, TimesLIVE met with Conrad Koch, the human behind the character, to get an idea of what to expect. Given all that has happened in the  past year, from vaccines to literal “unrest”, it is safe to say  Chester, the political analyst, has lots to reflect on, and “lots of looting jokes” are definitely on the table. “It’s always Chester. I’m just the guy that rides on his life,” explained Koch. “It’s  this amazing metaphor for South African politics  because he’s a puppet and  has this white guy benefitting from his life.” The dynamic duo have successfully used comedy, satire and  ventriloquy to get the nation engaging with politics in a different way, stepping on the toes of a few politicians along the way. “My goal is to create a piece of work that  digs to the core of the South African  and global conversation about race, apartheid, colonialism and injustice on a personal level and  larger level,”  said Koch. “Ventriloquism is an amazing way to communicate that because you’re talking to yourself, you’re reflecting on yourself.” TimesLIVE
