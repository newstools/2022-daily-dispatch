Reports that the ANC owes the SA Revenue Service (Sars) more than R100m in tax  have been met with criticism of  the ruling party, with some saying  it demonstrates that the  party  is incapable of running its own affairs, never mind the country. According to  Daily Maverick, the  ANC received a R102m tax bill from Sars and was given 10 days to settle  its account. It  reported  Sars turned to the high court in December to force the ruling party to pay. The court  issued a judgment instructing the sheriff to attach  ANCs assets valued at R102m. It is unclear if this was carried out. The party denied the report and said it was unaware of the order to attach its assets should it fail to  pay up. “Matters of taxation of the ANC are private and handled by the treasurer general’s office, who engages with Sars  on such affairs,” said the party. The ANC said it is committed to settling taxes owed to Sars. The report sparked debate on social media, where many slammed the party.
