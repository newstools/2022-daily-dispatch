Ukraine's President Volodymyr  Zelenskyy has warned Russia that the people of Ukraine are “unbreakable”. In his latest address on Thursday, Zelenskyy compared Russia's attack on Ukraine to the Covid-19 pandemic. “It's been a week now there's another virus attacked. A different disease and those who suffer from a harsh syndrome of annexation and occupation of foreign lands,” he said. Meanwhile, in Thailand, a group of pro-democracy fighters are hoping to join the war on the side of Ukraine. The group of friends are  planning to recruit others to their fight.
