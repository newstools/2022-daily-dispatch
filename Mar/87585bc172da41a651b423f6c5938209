Russia’s foreign minister Sergei Lavrov received an icy reception at the United Nations  in Geneva, Switzerland on Tuesday. Diplomats from  many countries got up and walked out of the room when he spoke. According to Euro News, this happened on two occasions. After the walk out, one diplomat told Reuters  the  UN needed to take a strong stance. Lavrov has sought to explain the Russian assault on Ukraine by  claiming the country was defending itself from nuclear attack. “Ukraine  has Soviet technologies and the means of delivery of such weapons. We cannot fail to respond to this real danger. Russia is a responsible member of the international community,” he said.
