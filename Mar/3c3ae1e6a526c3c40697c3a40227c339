Acting chief justice Raymond Zondo on Thursday afternoon had a media briefing after his appointment as chief justice  this month. During the briefing, Zondo  answered questions about how he felt to be appointed to such a position.  He said it was a “special honour”. Though asked many questions about his chairing of the  state capture inquiry and subsequent report, Zondo concentrated on  questions related to how he would execute his new position.  He said the one thing he wished to achieve by the end of his term was to ensure that the judiciary   attained “institutional independence”.
