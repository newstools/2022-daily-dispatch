Former finance minister Tito Mboweni’s recent  comment about the ANC being a political movement for the advancement of black people has  set tongues wagging online. Over the weekend Mboweni sparked a major debate after claiming the ruling party   continued to be a dependable political movement to advance black people and democratic South Africans. He said the party was  dependable, despite the challenges it has been going through. “Throughout all the challenges the ANC has been going through and has gone through, my observation is  we are still the dependable political movement for the advancement of black people in general, Africans in particular and democratic South Africans.” His comment drew mixed reactions from many, including One SA Movement leader Mmusi Maimane, who disagreed. Mboweni has previously expressed optimism about the ANC’s future, saying there is  time for the party to ensure it wins back the metros it lost to the DA. The former finance minister told ANC national chairperson Gwede Mantashe the  party must win the metros in the next municipal elections, which take place every five years. “The political pain of leadership. Askies, national chair, we must win the metros next time. Five years to go. Organise. Mobilise. Develop the country. Movement forward,” he said. On social media, many expressed different views.
