A second case of monkeypox has been detected in SA, the national health department reported on Tuesday. Health minister Joe Phaahla said the second patient is a 32-year-old male from Cape Town. The first case had been reported “He has no travel history which suggests that there is a high possibility of local transmission,” said Phaahla. “Though monkeypox is less contagious than smallpox and causes less-severe illness,  the situation is slowly evolving with cases being recorded,” Phaahla said. He called for the public to observe good hygiene practices and other preventive measures which proved to be effective against Covid-19 and other infectious diseases to prevent the spread of  the virus.
